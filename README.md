HI!ðŸ‘‹ This is my first complete game, overall it was a fun experience that lasted 4 months, I've learned a lot about game developing like game design and game programming, and, overall now i feel much more confident about steering my career towards game developing. I hope you like the game, and leave me your feedback.
